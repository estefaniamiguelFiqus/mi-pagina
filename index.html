		<h2> Our Story </h2>
		<p>The company was founded in 1964 in Hamilton, Ontario, by Canadian hockey player Tim Horton (1930–1974)
			 and Jim Charade (1934–2009), after an initial venture in hamburger restaurants. In 1967, Horton
			  partnered with investor Ron Joyce, who assumed control over operations after Horton died in 1974.
				Joyce expanded the chain into a multimillion-dollar franchise. Charade left the organization in 1966
				and briefly returned in 1970 and 1993 through 1996.</p>
